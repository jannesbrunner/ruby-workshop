# Ruby Workshop
This repository is all about my first footsteps with the amazing programming language 
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) !

You can find a more detailed descreption in each folder.
All the exercise in the folders are developed with the help of 
[TDD]() if you can find a *test.rb file(s).

## Exercises
All these following exercises got prepared and
challenged by [@alecsleo](https://github.com/alecsleo). 
Further workshops will get added here accordingly. 

### Playground
The very first footsteps with ruby. Playing around with the syntax and 
get comfy with ruby. 

### Navigator
A little program that takes coordinates as input and navigates with those through a
2D-room. Made with TDD.

### Rectangle 
A tiny code for descreping a rectangle and it's methods. Made with TDD.

### Binary Tree
An implemantation of an ordered binary tree. Traversing via depth-first and 
breadth-first algorithms. Made with TDD.

## How to use it

### Prerequisites

Almost every computer system running Windows, Mac, Linux (or other unix-like OS) can run
ruby. You also don't need a GUI. For compatibility reasons please make sure you run a ruby version
greater/equal `2.3.`
<br>
you can check that via
`$ ruby -v`

### Setup
*Windows* 
On Windows machines, you can use RubyInstaller or project's like [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).
If you are running Windows 10, you can also use the [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/commandline/wsl/about).


*Mac*
On OS X machines, you can use third-party tools (rbenv and RVM).
*Linux*
On Linux/UNIX, you can use the package management system of your distribution or third-party tools (rbenv and RVM).

Please check [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
for further instructions.

### Running
Just type
`$ ruby desired_file.rb` 
to run it.
