<img src="https://github.com/jannesbrunner/ruby-workshop/blob/master/ruby_workshop_logo.png">

This repository is all about my first footsteps with the amazing programming language <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>!

You can find a more detailed descreption in each folder.<br>
All the exercise in the folders are developed with the help of 
[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) if you can find a *test.rb file(s).

## Exercises
All these following exercises got prepared and
challenged by [@alecsleo](https://github.com/alecsleo). 
Further workshops will get added here accordingly. 

### Playground
The very first footsteps with ruby. Playing around with the syntax and 
get comfy with ruby. <br>
[=> Go To Playground](https://github.com/jannesbrunner/ruby-workshop/tree/master/0_playground)

### Navigator
A little program that takes coordinates as input and navigates with those through a
2D-room. Made with TDD. <br>
[=> Go To Navigator](https://github.com/jannesbrunner/ruby-workshop/tree/master/1_navigator)

### Rectangle 
A tiny code for descreping a rectangle and it's methods. Made with TDD. <br>
[=> Go To Rectangle](https://github.com/jannesbrunner/ruby-workshop/tree/master/2_rectangle)

### Binary Tree
An implemantation of an ordered binary tree. Traversing via depth-first and 
breadth-first algorithms. Made with TDD. <br>
[=> Go to Binary Tree](https://github.com/jannesbrunner/ruby-workshop/tree/master/3_binaryTree)

## Money
Money implemented via an money object that offers simple currency conversion. Made with TDD. <br>
[=> Go to Money](https://github.com/jannesbrunner/ruby-workshop/tree/master/4_money)

## How to use it

### Prerequisites

Almost every computer system running Windows, Mac, Linux (or other unix-like OS) can run
ruby. You also don't need a GUI. For compatibility reasons please make sure you run a ruby version
greater/equal `2.3.`
<br>
you can check that via
`$ ruby -v`

### Setup

*Windows* <br> 
On Windows machines, you can use RubyInstaller or project's like [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).
If you are running Windows 10, you can also use the [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/commandline/wsl/about).

*Mac*<br>
On OS X machines, you can use third-party tools (rbenv and RVM).

*Linux*<br>
On Linux/UNIX, you can use the package management system of your distribution or third-party tools (rbenv and RVM).

Please check [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
for further instructions.

### Running
Just type
`$ ruby desired_file.rb` 
to run it.
