# Ruby-Workshop / Navigator

This little program that takes coordinates as input and navigates with those through a 2D-room. It's Made with TDD. 
There are two classes, the navigator class and the position class. A position has two values, x and y. 
The Navigator class is using the positions for calculating the given input.

<br>

`$ ruby navigator_test.rb` runs the test cases for the navigator. <br>
`$ ruby position_test.rb` runs the test cases for the position class <br>
`$ ruby solve.rb` runs the program with the given input (in input.txt). <br>

You can adjust the data in *input.txt* to calculate other values.
